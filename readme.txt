THIS IS A TOOL FOR TEACHING CODING
-- This is a tool for shareing code as you write it. The class of students opens up a web page, and your code appears in thier view real-time.
-- Could be expanded with mouse pointer (teacher & student)
-- Could add chat
-- Could make the working directory changeable
-- Make ports customizable etc

REQUIREMENTS
-- A browser capable of WebSockets()
-- node.js

TO RUN
-- Find the bat file and use it to run the server
-- Runs fine from linux too though it will probs need SUDO permissions
-- Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/
-- Hopefully this works for everyone! You may need to fiddle with port numbers to get it to work for you. I have had no luck port-forwarding this. It was intended for LAN anyway :/
